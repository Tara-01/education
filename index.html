Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.

                    The transformation of education that educational systems must carry out to respond to the challenges of the 21st century is becoming more relevant due to the global circumstances of COVID-19 and the consequences of all kinds that it is causing. The author describes systemic proposals for change in the elements of the current model: curriculum, organization of students and teachers, and spaces.

                    <p class="small-text">Fresh Little Minds <u>Lets GROW Together</u> programme is a targeted early intervention programme tier 2 or 3 intervention for carers/parents and child/ren to undertake together.
                        This intervention has been successful in supporting and deescalating the stresses experienced by many families on waiting lists for CAMHS & ASD services.  Parents/carers are empowered to become proactive in supporting their own childrenâ€™s emotional wellbeing and coping strategies. Results have included a reduction in overwhelm, more empowered parents, and a clinical prediction for reduced risk for mental disorders including depression, anxiety, concentration disorder and ASD.
